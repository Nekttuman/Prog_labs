But there's a certain kind of comfort that I get from buying on
DVDs on sale, undershirts, things that I just don't need
Head down to target
I don't wanna go back home
It's there when I need it the most
Love is frozen in time
My heart is beating out of my chest
My jacket still smells like smoke
There are experiences you can't replace
